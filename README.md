# WIN Backend Engineering Interview

## Scenario

Your mission is to build a portion of an order management system. You need to provide a service that allows other systems and teams to obtain information about orders.

## Deliverables

There are two deliverables for this project:

1. An internal web service API for managing orders
2. A test suite to validate the web service and library work as expected

### General

- Please use either **JavaScript/TypeScript or Python**.
- You may use any framework, such as a web framework or test framework, to help you complete the project.
- You may store the data for this system in any database you choose, however we've included a Docker image loaded with Postgres in this repo.
- You may model the data any way you'd like, including adding data beyond the samples provided.

### Web Service

- Your service should implement several endpoints that accept POST, GET, PUT and DELETE requests. Also 1 endpoint that accepts GET all orders.
- Your service should handle edge cases appropriately and return appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Your service should return an error on creation/updating an order within 3 hrs of a pre-existing order.
- Your service should return JSON results.
- Your service should have at least one test.

## Sample Data

Below is some sample data you can use to populate your database. Feel free to extend or modify this data for your project:

Service Records

```json
[
  {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "Inspection"
  },
  {
    "id": 789,
    "name": "Testing"
  },
  {
    "id": 456,
    "name": "Analysis"
  }
]
```

Orders

```json
[
  {
    "id": "223",
    "datetime": "2022-11-01T11:11:11.111Z",
    "totalfee": 100,
    "services": [
        {
        "id": "123",
        }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "224",
    "datetime": "2022-11-01T11:11:11.111Z",
    "totalfee": 100,
    "services": [
        {
        "id": "789",
        }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": "225",
    "datetime": "2022-11-01T11:11:11.111Z",
    "totalfee": 100,
    "services": [
        {
        "id": "456",
        }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Duration

Up to 2 hours.

## Submission
1.  Clone this repo
2.  Create Web Services and tests
3.  Submit a Pull Request (PR)
4.  In the PR, include a README that includes the following:
      - A description of your solution at a high-level, including language used, framework used, roughly how it works, etc.
      - What trade-offs you made
      - Any assumptions you made that affected your solution
      - What you would change if you built this for production
      - Brief instructions on how to setup the environment to run your project
      - What parts of the spec were completed, how much time you spent, and any particular problems you ran into

## Evaluation
We are looking for: 
1. Communication
2. Solution Design
3. Completeness
4. Code clarity / readability




## ANSWER

### introduction 

- Technology  - node js express js
- Language    - typescript
- Database     - Mongodb
  
### description 

- Added postman collection for all api 
- `Service` - 4 API for (CRUD operation)
- `Order` - 2 API for get all order and add order
- archive `84.12% test coverage`
- time take 1.55 hr
  
### make sure you have mongod install in local and working fine i also added .env because we donot have any sercet so..
### for run this project 
``` bash
nvm use 
```
``` bash
yarn
```
```bash
yarn dev
```
### for run test cases
``` bash
yarn test
```
### producton lavel changes


- Take add static string value from constant folder 
- Take all static status codes from the constant folder 
- Use auth token to verify the user 
- Store the user`s ref in DB to identify items by the user 
- Add type guarding for error
- Write perfect error code for different error 
- Handle errors on a global level
- Write test cases for DB  connection and other function
- Create 100% test coverage
